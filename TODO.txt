--------- ALL LONG TERM TASKS / FIXES BELONG TO GOOGLE DOCS: ImplementationTODO OR PossibleImprovements ----------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assembly refresh

When serializing Camera I cannot save the reference to RenderTexture. Make it a Resource?
Possibly set up automatic refresh in debug mode after initialization? As an ad-hoc unit test

Modal windows are set up as persistent but I don't serialize their internal data anywhere

----------------------------------------------------------------------
C# Material/Shader:

TODO - Implement param block and sampler support
TODO - When creating a Material without a shader, a default one should be used, at least in editor
TODO - Setting Material array parameters isn't possible from C#

GUIResourceField doesn't distinguish between tex2d, tex3d and texcube.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
ProjectLibrary import

I'm not sure if queued dependencies are handled properly. They're handled on an internal ProjectLibrary loop but perhaps I should
return them in checkForModifications?

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prefab diff

Add "dirty object" system to C#. Each ScriptResource and ScriptGameObject should have a dirty flag.
 - It should be toggle-able via EditorUtility.SetDirty or similar. (Possibly make this part of ProjectLibrary)
 - There should also be a method to check if something is dirty via EditorUtility.IsDirty or similar. (Possibly make this part of ProjectLibrary)
  - Hook this up to Scene.IsModified because it is currently not implemented (Might need to keep a link to active Prefab in scene to do this)
 - Add a "Save Project" button that automatically saves all dirty assets. Do this automatically when user quits the editor.
 - Call SetDirty manually whenever:
  - A new object or component is added to the scene
  - An object or component is removed from the scene
  - An object is reparented
  - When component or resource is modified from inspector
 - Record all portions where objects & components get modified so I can mark them dirty, will likely need
    to use those some points for undo/redo

 Test (likely later once I have more editor functionality working):
  - Game object handle compare
  - ID restore systems 
  - Native+Managed diff (only the link between the two)

Code quality improvements:
 - Modify BinarySerializer so that _encodeIntermediate outputs intermediate format directly without a full on encode
 - Consider making ManagedSerializable* array/list/dictionary method/field references static (right now each instance has its own instance
   but they're identical)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Polish

Move data folder within current repo
 - Store default layout asset in Data/Editor folder
 - Store data generated by editor runtime at Data/Runtime

Add Create Project & Open Project entries in main menu
Rename ProjectWindow to LibraryWindow
Store last open project location, should the last project be loaded by default, and a list of all known projects (listed by last opened date)
(Store last open level too. WIll likely need ProjectSettings similar to EditorSettings)
ProjectWindow
 - Show this on start-up if last open project is empty or load last project is off
  - Main editor window should show up but nothing should be loaded in it 
    (see how to handle that best? - isProjectLoaded() and have ProjectLibrary and similar check for that)
  - Contains an input box for project to open
  - Below it is a scroll are with a list of most recent projects, selecting one changes the value in input box, double-clicking opens that project
  - To the right is a Browse button that allows you to find an existing project
    - When selected call a method CheckIfValidProject that confirms selected folder exists and has all the proper files, throw warning otherwise
      - Do this when opening a project from the most recent list as well, if it fails remove it from most recent list
    - Browsed to project is added to the most recent list and opened, if valid
  - Below browse is Load button that loads the project currently in the input box (with the check above)
  - On the bottom below Load is Create button that allows you to choose a folder in which to create a new project

When creating a new project:
 - Copy default layout from Data/Editor to the project folder
 - Create Resources & Internal folders
 - Unload the current project (clear scene, clear project library)
 - Refresh project library so it points to new location

Ribek use:
 - Hook up color picker to guicolor field
 - When starting drag from hierarchy tree view it tends to select another object (can't repro)
 - Camera, Renderable, Material, Texture inspector
 - Project create/open window
 - Load default layout on initial start
 - Test release mode
 - Ability to create assets in Project view (At least Material)
 - (Optionally, needed for GUI editing) GUISkin resource inspector & a way to inspect and save the default editor skin

First screenshot:
 - Additional menu bar items: 
  - Edit: Undo/Redo, Cut/Copy/Paste/Duplicate/Delete(need to make sure it works in Hierarchy, with shortcuts), Frame Selected, Preferences, Play/Pause/Step, View/Move/rotate/scale
  - Assets (also add to context): Create(Folder, Material, Shader, Script, Prefab, GUI Skin), Show in explorer
  - Game Object (also add to context): Create(Empty, Empty Child, Camera, Renderable, Point/Spot/Directional Light), Apply prefab, Break prefab, Revert prefab
   - Possibly create helper objects: Cube, Sphere, Plane, Quad, Capsule, Cylinder
  - Help - About, API Reference (link to site)
 - (Optionally) New UI look (tabs, component/array containers, better buttons)
   - Foldout in scene tree view is hard to click, make it bigger
 - (Optionally) Console window

Other polish:
 - Crash on shutdown in mono_gchandle_free
 - C# inspectors for Point/Spot/Directional light
 - C# interface for Font
 - Handle seems to lag behind the selected mesh
 - ProjectLibrary seems to import some files on every start-up
 - Replace "minimize" button in tabbed title bar with maximize and make sure it works (in both docked and floating mode)
 - When I expand inspector elements and them come back to that object it should remember the previous state
   - Add a chaching mechanism to inspector (likely based on instance ID & property names)
   - This has to work not only when I come back to the object, but whenever inspector rebuilds (e.g. after removing element from array)
   - Consider saving this information with the serialized object
 - Make sure to persist EditorSettings
 - Import option inspectors for Texture, Mesh, Font
 - When opening editor load last open scene

Stage 2 polish:
 - Inject an icon into an .exe (Win32 specific)
 - Prefabs
 - Game window
 - Game play/pause/step (+ save/restore objects on play/pause switch)
 - Resource hotswap
 - C# script compiling in editor
 - VS integration
 - When managed exception happens log an error and continue execution
 - Game publishing (Build window, collect resources, output exe, default viewport) (described below)

Finalizing:
 - Add copyright notices in all files & change license to GPL
 - UseCustomInspector isn't implemented
 - Move all the code files into subfolders so their hierarchy is similar to VS filters
 - Splash screen
 - Settings/Preferences window
 - Documentation
 - Need to generate a proper merge of dev and preview branches
 - Save/Load project menu item does nothing at the moment
 - (Optionally) GUI tabbing to switch between elements
 - Undo/Redo
  - CmdRecordSO records an SO and all its children but it should only record a single SO
  - CmdRecordSO should instead of recording the entire object record a diff
  - There should be a CmdRecordSO equivalent for resources (probably)
  - Add commands for breaking or reverting a scene object 
  - Test & finalize undo/redo system
 - Update GUISlider so it works with the new style (and to have min/max limits, plus step size)
 - Add "focus on object" key (F) - animate it: rotate camera towards then speed towards while zooming in
 - Ortographic camera views (+ gizmo in scene view corner that shows camera orientation)
 - Drag to select in scene view
 - MenuBar - will likely need a way to mark elements as disabled when not appropriate (e.g. no "frame selected unless scene is focused")
   - Likely use a user-provided callback to trigger when populating the menus
 - Need to list all script components in the Components menu

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Build system
 - Test Resources (if loading works and if they're properly packaged in build)
 - The final build procedure for the game should be:
   - Copy all the prebuilt binaries (Banshee libraries, Banshee assemblies, 3rd party libraries and prebuilt executable) from Editor install folder to output folder
    - Which set of binaries is used depends on selected platform (e.g. win/mac/linux or 32/64bit)
   - Recompile script assemblies if needed and copy them from project Internal folder to output folder
   - Copy the Builtin resources for engine from Editor install folder to output folder
   - Copy all the resources marked with the flag mentioned above to \Data subfolder in the output folder, preserving the same asset structure
   - Make sure to go over texture resources and ensure they are saved in the valid format
     as we don't want to do format conversion at runtime (Not cruical, but it should be done eventually)
     - This should something similar to Unity where when changing the platform all resources get reimported
   - Make sure to clear all prefab diffs (possibly store them elsewhere in the first place)
	 - And all prefab instances should have updateFromPrefab called on them.

Other

There is a memory corruption happening. Haven't determined where exactly but it's possible it has something
to do with the opening of ColorPicker window. One time I got a heap read after delete error caused by GUIManager
attempting to allocate a new transient mesh, and another time I got a hang when inserting a script object into a std::set.

Got a crash on shutdown that was caused by locking a mutex in an Event destructor. Event was Platform::onMouseCaptureChanged. 
Issue happened when I closed the app via the X button (if that's relevant). It doesn't seem to happen always.
 - This is likely due to some other error. When VS finds an exception it triggers a dialog box which triggers the msg loop in-engine and causes another exception.

Mono notes

I can get mono errors by checking g_print calls in goutput.c
 - Calling thunks incorrectly can cause those weird errors with no real callstack

Running embedded mono with VS attached causes managed null refs to be registered as access violations

There seems to be a bug in Mono when passing complex structs from C# to C++. e.g. passing Rect3 as a parameter
will corrupt the parameter after it, even if layout and size is exact as the C++ version. 
Rect3 has child structs (Vector3) which could be the reason. Be aware of other similar problems.

Mono cannot marshal structures? Taken from their documentation:
 Internal calls do not provide support for marshalling structures. This means that any API calls that take a structure 
 (excluding the system types like int32, int64, etc) must be passed as a pointer, in C# this means passing the value as a "ref" or "out" parameter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
MenuItem

 - Add keyboard controls to GUIMenuBar (left/right arrows should move between entries if user is not browsing a sub-menu)
  - esc should cancel out of the menu bar
  - alt should focus the menu bar

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VisualStudio integration

 - VS integration will likely not work with VSExpress or Community edition
  - VSExpress doesn't support EnvDTE so the only option is to open it using a shell command which doesn't seem to offer precise parameters
  - Community edition should work similarily to Pro, but might have a different executable and/or registry paths
 - Make sure that 3rd party assemblies can be imported in the project, and that they are properly referenced in VS project generation and compilation

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Script compilation

 - I need to hook up script compilation with assembly refresh, and the build system.
   - e.g. when recompiling inside the editor it should automatically start compiling when changes are detected,
     show some kind of visual indicator and refresh assemblies when its done. When publishing it should recompile
	 assemblies for release. Also hook up console to compiler output?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Project window

 - Might need to improve search (need to test). Do multiple search keywords work properly?
 - Consider delaying search until user stops pressing keys (so not to have thousands of search results in the initial stages)
 - Save & restore scroll position when Refresh happens

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Handles

 - Ideally free scale handle indicator should always render and be interactable and never be hidden by axis scale indicators (Not high priority)
 - Raycast snapping Ribek suggested

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Include files:

 - Test if default values work
 - Test project library dependant resources (e.g. changing an include and seeing if shader is reimported)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene View

Test:
 - Custom handles from C#
 - Handle snapping
 - Multi-select Move/Rotate/scale
