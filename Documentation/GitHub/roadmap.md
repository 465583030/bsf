# Roadmap

**Current version: v0.2**

---------------------------------------------------

Banshee is currently in development, and the focus right now is to finish the most important high level systems so that people can start using it to create games as soon as possible. These systems are:
 - Physics (colliders, triggers, rigidbodies, joints, character controller)
 - Animation (skeletal, blend shapes, generic script variables)
 - Audio (popular file format support, music, 3D audio)
 
The plan is to finish these roughly around mid-2016.

---------------------------------------------------

Quickly to follow will be:
 - Ports for Linux & Mac
 - Vulkan (and possibly DX12) implementation
 - Physically based renderer
 - Website for the community
 
These are planned for an early 2017 release.

---------------------------------------------------

There are many more features planned, but these are without a specific timeline or order:
 - Mobile render API (likely Vulkan, possibly Metal for iOS)
 - Android/iOS/WP ports
 - High level networking (replication, RPCs)
 - Global illumination (+ other fancy graphics)
 - Occlussion culling
 - Terrain
 - Effects/Particle editor
 - AI support
 - Cinematics editor
 - Higher level resource streaming support (including level and texture streaming)
 - Unified shading language (with exposed hooks for visual shader node editor)
 - Much more...
 
A very rough estimate is about two months each for every one of these features. If community joins in this could go a lot faster. Or if someone ends up funding Banshee development we could speed this up by hiring another developer or two.
