# Compiling

Banshee compiles on VS2015 - earlier versions might work with minor modifications. Other Windows compilers might work but have not been tested. Support for more platforms and compilers will become available with time.

Aside from Banshee source code you will also need various third party dependencies. You may retrieve/compile those dependencies yourself by following a guide in "CompilingDependenciesManually.txt". If you are using VS2015 you can avoid compiling dependencies by downloading the archive below, containing a set of pre-compiled dependencies. These should be extracted in the root of the directory containing Banshee source code.

The archive below also contains all non-code resources (images, shaders) required for the editor, engine and example projects.
