# About

Banshee was created and is developed by Marko Pintera. Its primary goal to provide an extremely intuitive interface for developing games, while having high quality graphics, with optimized and fast code. Another major goal is to design an engine that is truly extensible so others can easily learn and modify it, as well as use it as a basis for their own engines and other projects.

This project was born as a dream to create a game engine on my own. I wanted primarily to learn about every aspect of engine development and to create a quality codebase I can use for my own game projects. Eventually it evolved into something bigger and I decided to share it with the world.

I'm happy to connect with other developers, so feel free to contact me at [e-mail] (http://scr.im/39d1) or add me on [LinkedIn] (https://goo.gl/t6pPPs).
