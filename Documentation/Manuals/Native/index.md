Banshee Engine Documentation (Native)						{#mainpage}
===============

[TOC]

Welcome to the documentation for the native (C++) API of the Banshee Engine.

This documentation contains a set of [manuals](@ref manuals), an <a class="el" href="modules.html">API reference</a> and an alphabetical <a class="el" href="annotated.html">class list</a>.

# Manuals # {#mainpage_a}
Manuals should be your primary entry point into learning about Banshee. They will provide you with a view of the general architecture of the engine, as well as the architecture of the more important systems. They will also teach you have to extend/modify various parts of the engine, including adding custom GUI types, script objects, resources, importers, renderers and many more.
 
The manuals generally do not cover user-facing functionality, and focus more on explaining the engine internals. To learn about user-facing functionality read the [scripting documentation](@ref TODO_LINK) - the C++ interfaces are very similar and are usually just a direct reflection of their script counterparts.

# API Reference # {#mainpage_b}
API reference provides a categorized and hierarchical view of all the engine's classes. 

All classes are categorized into three primary groups:
 - **Layers** - Layers make up the core of the engine. Each layer is built directly on top of the previous one. This is what most people will be interested in.
 - **Plugins** - Plugins are various interchangeable libraries that contain high level systems built on top of abstractions defined in the layers.
 - **Implementation** - This contains all the helper types used for implementation. This is included due to a limitation in our documentation system, and the user should generally never need to access types here manually.
 
You should read the [architecture](@ref architecture) manual for a more detailed breakdown of the architecture.
