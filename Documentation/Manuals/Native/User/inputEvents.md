Input events						{#inputEvents}
===============

Events represent another way of handling user input. They are an alternative to input polling, and it's up to the developer to choose which way of handling input he prefers. These approaches aren't identical though, and events can provide more information to the developer. Same as polling, events are also handled by the **Input** class.
