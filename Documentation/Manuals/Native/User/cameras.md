Cameras 						{#cameras}
===============

Cameras represent the user's view into the scene. They are components represented by the @ref bs::CCamera "Camera" component.

Their position and orientation defines which part of the scene will the user see. Their parameters like field of view, projection mode and aspect ratio define how is the 3D scene transformed into the 2D surface. And they also define an output surface into which the scene will be rendered to.
