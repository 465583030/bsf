Polish TODO:
 - Finish basic example, get a model rendering on screen
 - Fix FBX importer so proper number of vertices show
 - Test and fix full-screen transitions
 - Add virtual input axes
 - Compress and generate mips for texture on input (testing NVTT stuff)
 - Add frustum culling and sorting code
 - Finalize example
 - Perform optimizations as needed to get reasonable performance

 - Add license text to all files
 - Make a separate release branch with no editor/script stuff, and without .txt files and other development data
 - (HIGHLY OPTIONAL) Make a Getting Started guide, along with the example project. Or just finish up the manual.

Rebuild OIS with XINPUT support (OIS_WIN32_XINPUT_SUPPORT)
Rename CamelotOIS to BansheeOIS

TODO - How do I convert joystick buttons to in-engine button codes?
TODO - I don't have timestamps for joystick buttons

Mouse sensitivity/sampling rate/whatever needs to be tweaked
 - Use DirectInput DIPROPRANGE and SetProperty/GetProperty?

Add smoothing
  - See http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Smooth_Mouse_Filtering.shtml or UE4 implementation
  - UE4 seems to receive multiple mouse samples per frame. I only sample input once per frame

-----------------

There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

I should be able to specify resolution when going to windowed mode
 - I have a feeling DX9 might start crashing once I resize to sub-fullscreen res and go back to FS - test it

 Add VSync toggle to RenderWindow if it doesn't already exist.
 Test creating a fullscreen window on window creation.

DISREGARD MONITOR INDEX ON DX9
 - It's not trivial and its not worth wasting time on a deprecated system
 - Seems I would need to destroy the device and then recreate it using the new adapter index

 -----------------------------

Refactor GUIElement & GUIElementBase
 - Sprite rendering methods should probably be marked as internal (possibly others too)
  - A lot could be made private
 - Has two methods for retrieveing ElementType
 - getVisibleBounds doesn't make sense

 To document:
  - Finish up BansheeEngine
  - DX11, DX9

Editor and script stuff should be removed from release version
