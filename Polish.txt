Polish TODO:
 - Finish basic example, get a model rendering on screen
 - Fix FBX importer so proper number of vertices show
 - Finish and test GPU profiler
 - Test and fix full-screen transitions
 - Add virtual input axes
 - Compress and generate mips for texture on input (testing NVTT stuff)
 - Add frustum culling and sorting code
 - Finalize example
 - Perform optimizations as needed to get reasonable performance

 - Add license text to all files
 - Make a separate release branch with no editor/script stuff, and without .txt files and other development data
 - (HIGHLY OPTIONAL) Make a Getting Started guide, along with the example project. Or just finish up the manual.

-----------------

There's still a crash regarding an uninitialized mCachedPtr on a C# class when shutting down. Attempt to find consistent repro steps.

Finish GPUProfiler:
 - Resource writes/reads/creation/destruction is not currently increased in RenderStats
   - Make RenderStats global so resources can more easily access those methods.
 - Test overlay and add title labels for samples

 ---------------------------

 Make hierarchical documentation. Organize stuff based on type. Once I actually generate the documentation add Doxygen grouping tags (or whatever they're called)

 ---------------------------

 Fullscreen stuff:

I should be able to specify resolution when going to windowed mode
 - I have a feeling DX9 might start crashing once I resize to sub-fullscreen res and go back to FS - test it

 Add VSync toggle to RenderWindow if it doesn't already exist.
 Test creating a fullscreen window on window creation.

DISREGARD MONITOR INDEX ON DX9
 - It's not trivial and its not worth wasting time on a deprecated system
 - Seems I would need to destroy the device and then recreate it using the new adapter index

 -----------------------------

Rename CamelotOIS external library

Refactor GUIElement & GUIElementBase
 - Sprite rendering methods should probably be marked as internal (possibly others too)
  - A lot could be made private
 - Has two methods for retrieveing ElementType
 - getVisibleBounds doesn't make sense

 To document:
  - Finish up BansheeEngine
  - DX11, DX9

Editor and script stuff should be removed from release version
