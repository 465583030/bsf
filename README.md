# BansheeEngine

A modern open-source game development toolkit. It aims to provide simple yet powerful environment for creating 3D/2D games and other graphical applications. A wide range of features are available, ranging from a math and utility library, to DirectX 11 and OpenGL render systems all the way to asset processing, physics, GUI, fully featured editor and C# scripting.

For game developers Banshee aims to provide a complete set of tools and APIs needed to make a game from start to finish. It provides a highly intuitive and customizable editor that is easy to use by artists, designers and programmers alike, supporting development stages from asset management, scene building, scripting to game publishing. C# scripting makes your development easier by giving you access to the entire .NET library, along with fast iterations times while being safe and easy to write. Editor is fully extensible with the help of specially developed scripting API so you may customize it for exact needs of your project.

For engine developers it aims to provide a high quality foundation to build and improve upon. Banshee runs on a powerful multi-threaded C++14 core created to take advantage of all resources modern hardware can offer. Built from ground up using modern design principles, everything is modular, layered and decoupled as much as possible, making it easier to modify, replace or add functionality. Platform specific functionality is kept at a minimum making porting as easy as possible. Additionally every non-trivial method, class and field is documented. All this combined makes Banshee a great platform to build upon, for developing higher level systems like editor tools, core enhancements like new rendering techniques and platform ports, all the way to creating fully specialized toolsets that fit your team's needs exactly.

## About

Banshee was created and is developed by Marko Pintera. Its primary goal to provide an extremely intuitive interface for developing games, while having high quality graphics, with optimized and fast code. Another major goal is to design an engine that is truly extensible so others can easily learn and modify it, as well as use it as a basis for their own engines and other projects. For that reason a special care has been taken to design it neatly with no shortcuts and to fully document the code.

This project was born as a dream to create a game engine on my own. I wanted primarily to learn about every aspect of engine development and to create a quality codebase I can use for my own game projects. Eventually it evolved into something bigger and I decided to share it with the world. It's still a work in progress but I believe its moving towards being something pretty great!
