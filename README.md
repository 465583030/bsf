# BansheeEngine

A free & modern multi-platform game development toolkit. It aims to provide simple yet powerful environment for creating games and other graphical applications. A wide range of features are available, ranging from a math and utility library, to DirectX 11 and OpenGL render systems all the way to asset processing, fully featured editor and C# scripting.

Banshee aims to become a standard in game development by providing rock solid implementations of known and widely used techniques while also being flexible enough to implement constantly changing cutting edge techniques. Built from ground up to be a modern library using modern design principles. Everything is modular, layered and decoupled as much as possible, making it easier to modify, replace or add functionality. Platform specific functionality is kept at a minimum making porting as easy as possible. Additionally every non-trivial method, class and field is documented.

On top of the powerful and flexible C++ core lies a fully featured editor and a C# scripting system. C# scripting makes your development easier by giving you access to the entire .NET library, along with fast iterations times while being safe and easy to write. Editor is fully extensible with the help of C# scripting so you may customize it for exact needs of your project.

## Download/Install

To get Banshee to run you will need to check out the source code either from GitHub or download the source code package below. Additionally you will need dependencies only available for download below. Dependencies should be extracted in the same folder as the root folder of the project (they share folder structure so it should be easy to see what goes where).

To compile Banshee you will need Visual Studio 2013 (Express version will work, but earlier Visual Studio versions will not). Other Windows compilers might work but have not been tested. Support for more platforms and compilers will become available with time.

## Jump in

Easiest way to get started with Banshee is to check out `ExampleProject` included with the source code. However to give you a taste here are a few code snippets.

### Starting a minimal application
```
  RENDER_WINDOW_DESC renderWindowDesc;
  renderWindowDesc.videoMode = VideoMode(1280, 720);
  renderWindowDesc.title = "My App";
  renderWindowDesc.fullscreen = false;
	
  Application::startUp(renderWindowDesc, RenderSystemPlugin::DX11);
  Application::instance().runMainLoop();
  Application::shutDown();
```

### Importing resources
```
  HMesh dragonModel = static_resource_cast<Mesh>(Importer::instance().import("Dragon.fbx"));
  HTexture dragonTexture = static_resource_cast<Texture>(Importer::instance().import("Dragon.psd"));
```

### Adding and positioning a camera
```
  HSceneObject sceneCameraSO = SceneObject::create("SceneCamera");
  HCamera sceneCamera = sceneCameraSO->addComponent<Camera>(window);

  sceneCameraSO->setPosition(Vector3(40.0f, 30.0f, 230.0f));
  sceneCameraSO->lookAt(Vector3(0, 0, 0));
```

### Adding an object for rendering
```
  HSceneObject dragonSO = SceneObject::create("Dragon");
  
  HRenderable renderable = dragonSO->addComponent<Renderable>();
  renderable->setMesh(dragonModel);
  renderable->setMaterial(dragonMaterial);
```

### Adding GUI
```
  HSceneObject guiSO = SceneObject::create("GUI");
  HCamera guiCamera = guiSO->addComponent<Camera>(window);
  
  HGUIWidget gui = guiSO->addComponent<GUIWidget>(guiCamera->getViewport().get());
  GUIArea* guiArea = GUIArea::createStretchedXY(*gui, 0, 0, 0, 0);
  guiArea->getLayout().addElement(GUIButton::create(HString(L"Click me!")));
  guiArea->getLayout().addElement(GUIButton::create(HString(L"Click me too!")));
```

# Author

Banshee is developed by Marko Pintera. I created and built the entire project from my bedroom in my free time out of personal interest in game engine development, never having had the chance to do it professionally. 

I appreciate any feedback at marko.pintera@com.gmail (antispam: flip gmail/com).
