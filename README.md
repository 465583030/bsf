# BansheeEngine

A modern open-source game development toolkit. It aims to provide simple yet powerful environment for creating games and other graphical applications. A wide range of features are available, ranging from a math and utility library, to DirectX 11 and OpenGL render systems all the way to asset processing, fully featured editor and C# scripting.

Banshee aims to become a standard in game development by providing rock solid implementations of known and widely used techniques while also being flexible enough to implement constantly changing cutting edge techniques. Built from ground up to be a modern library using modern design principles - everything is modular, layered and decoupled as much as possible, making it easier to modify, replace or add functionality. Platform specific functionality is kept at a minimum making porting as easy as possible. Additionally every non-trivial method, class and field is documented.

On top of the powerful and flexible C++ core lies a fully featured editor and a C# scripting system. C# scripting makes your development easier by giving you access to the entire .NET library, along with fast iterations times while being safe and easy to write. Editor is fully extensible with the help of C# scripting so you may customize it for exact needs of your project.

## Download/Install

Downloading pre-compiled binaries is the easiest way to check out Banshee if you don't want to go through the hassle of compiling it yourself. But be aware that this a development version and you should expect bugs and missing features.

## Compiling from source

Banshee compiles on VS2013 and VS2015. Other Windows compilers might work but have not been tested. Support for more platforms and compilers will become available with time.

Aside from Banshee source code you will also need various third party dependencies. You may retrieve/compile those dependencies yourself by following a guide in "CompilingDependenciesManually.txt". If you are using VS2015 you can avoid compiling dependencies by downloading a set of pre-compiled dependencies below. These should be extracted in the root of the directory containing Banshee source code.

## Development state

Project is currently in active development. Current version is considered a preview version. Bugs are to be expected and new features will be added as development progresses.

## Getting started

Banshee is a multi-layered engine that aims to be flexible enough to handle various needs. Therefore this section is split into two sub-sections, first one aimed for game developers (high-level C# programmers, artists, designers) and engine developers (low level C++ programmers).

### Getting started (Game developers)

TODO - Create a simple editor project with a mesh, texture and a basic script. Show the user how to load the project, add the objects to scene, attach the script, tweak material & script values and start playing the game. Provide a small tutorial on the C# scripting API as well (creating a scene object, custom component, handling input, moving the camera).

### Getting started (Engine developers)

Easiest way to get started with low-level Banshee programming is to check out the `ExampleProject` included with the source code. However to give you a taste here are a few code snippets.

#### Starting a minimal application
```
  RENDER_WINDOW_DESC renderWindowDesc;
  renderWindowDesc.videoMode = VideoMode(1280, 720);
  renderWindowDesc.title = "My App";
  renderWindowDesc.fullscreen = false;
	
  Application::startUp(renderWindowDesc, RenderSystemPlugin::DX11);
  Application::instance().runMainLoop();
  Application::shutDown();
```

#### Importing resources
```
  HMesh dragonModel = gImporter().import<Mesh>("Dragon.fbx");
  HTexture dragonTexture = gImporter().import<Texture>("Dragon.psd");
```

#### Adding and positioning a camera
```
  HSceneObject sceneCameraSO = SceneObject::create("SceneCamera");
  HCamera sceneCamera = sceneCameraSO->addComponent<Camera>(window);

  sceneCameraSO->setPosition(Vector3(40.0f, 30.0f, 230.0f));
  sceneCameraSO->lookAt(Vector3(0, 0, 0));
```

#### Adding an object for rendering
```
  HSceneObject dragonSO = SceneObject::create("Dragon");
  
  HRenderable renderable = dragonSO->addComponent<Renderable>();
  renderable->setMesh(dragonModel);
  renderable->setMaterial(dragonMaterial);
```

#### Adding GUI
```
  HSceneObject guiSO = SceneObject::create("GUI");
  HCamera guiCamera = guiSO->addComponent<Camera>(window);
  HGUIWidget gui = guiSO->addComponent<GUIWidget>(guiCamera);
  
  GUIPanel* guiPanel = gui->getPanel();
  GUILayout* guiLayout = guiPanel->addNewElement<GUILayoutY>();
  guiLayout->addNewElement<GUIButton>(HString(L"Click me!"));
  guiLayout->addNewElement<GUIButton>(HString(L"Click me too!"));
```
