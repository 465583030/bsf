Set up MinGW environment so you can compile Bison:
 - Download MinGW from: http://www.mingw.org/ and install
  - Make sure your installation has these packages:
     - mingw-developer-toolkit
     - mingw32-base
     - msys-base
  - Launch MSYS from MinGW/msys/1.0/msys.bat
  - Mount MinGW in MSYS: mount c:/mingw /mingw

Download Bison source from: https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/ and extract it somewhere on your system.
Configure and compile:
 - Launch MSYS from MinGW/msys/1.0/msys.bat
 - input "path/to/bison/folder/configure --prefix=/mingw" (no quotes) and wait
  - replace "path/to/bison/folder" with actual path. Do not call "./configure" while you are in Bison folder. You must be outside of it, 
    and then input the path to configure as shown above, otherwise you will run into issues with linking.
 - input "make" (no quotes) and wait
If successful your "bison.exe" executable will be in /src subfolder of the folder you called configure and make in.
