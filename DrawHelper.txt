 Only one material per viewport needs to exist, no need for separate material for each element

AA line stuff doesn't work in 3d unless I specify a plane :/
 - A better way might be to draw two lines in an X (for lines)
 - And for polygons use the normal formed by their triangle
 - See how Recast draws 3d lines and polys

Make sure AABox can be rendered transparently and make sure it gets sorted properly
