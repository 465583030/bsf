I get an error when serializing a material
 - I'm assuming its because one shader block is renderer manager and not created at the time of serialization

Resizing SceneView requires a resize() method on RenderTexture
 - Add resize() method to RenderTexture and normal Texture
Add a basic 3D model so SceneView actually displays something

Think about how gizmos will be rendered
 - Both quad icon-like ones
 - And ones for bounding boxes, camera frustum, etc.

Picking
 - Create core thread class that accepts a screen coordinate and a camera and it determines object at its position
 - System then renders all visible objects with diferent colors 
 - Image then needs to be read back to determine what was hit
 - Result is returned via async op
 - Needs to support multi-select where I draw a rectangle on screen
 - NOTE: I will also need to render gizmos which I assume will all be within a single buffer. This might require special care since normally I can color each buffer with a different color, which won't work in this case.
     - Similar issue might happen with particles and other systems
