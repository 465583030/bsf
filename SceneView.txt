Resizing SceneView requires a resize() method on RenderTexture

Picking
 - Create core thread class that accepts a screen coordinate and a camera and it determines object at its position
 - System then renders all visible objects with diferent colors 
 - Image then needs to be read back to determine what was hit
 - Result is returned via async op
 - Needs to support multi-select where I draw a rectangle on screen
 - NOTE: I will also need to render gizmos which I assume will all be within a single buffer. This might require special care since normally I can color each buffer with a different color, which won't work in this case.
     - Similar issue might happen with particles and other systems
