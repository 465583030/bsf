Resizing SceneView requires a resize() method on RenderTexture
 - Add resize() method to RenderTexture and normal Texture

Think about how gizmos will be rendered
 - Both quad icon-like ones
 - And ones for bounding boxes, camera frustum, etc.

Picking
 - Create core thread class that accepts a screen coordinate and a camera and it determines object at its position
 - System then renders all visible objects with diferent colors 
 - Image then needs to be read back to determine what was hit
 - Result is returned via async op
 - Needs to support multi-select where I draw a rectangle on screen
 - NOTE: I will also need to render gizmos which I assume will all be within a single buffer. This might require special care since normally I can color each buffer with a different color, which won't work in this case.
     - Similar issue might happen with particles and other systems


--------------------------

RenderTarget (and in turn, Viewport) make data available to sim thread, even though that data can be arbitrarily modified from the core thread

Stuff that needs to be synchronized:
 mIsFullscreen
 mWidth
 mHeight
 mHidden
 mTop
 mLeft
 mHasFocus
 (more? check)

Core thread should have up to date access as it has now.
Sim thread should only get updated data next frame.
 - Ensure this happens before any RenderWindowManager events

-------------

Option:
 - Keep two copies of data in RenderTarget/RenderTexture/RenderWindow
 - Whenever stuff gets modified from core thread a notification is sent to RenderTargetManager which queues an update to refresh the sim thread data
 - Core thread data is updated from sim thread as normal

How will the external methods know which version of data to use?
