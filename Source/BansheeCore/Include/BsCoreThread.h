	 * Manager for the core thread. Takes care of starting, running, queuing commands and shutting down the core thread.
	 * 			
	 * @note	
	 * How threading works:
	 * 	- This class contains a queue which is filled by commands from other threads via queueCommand() and queueReturnCommand()  
	 * 	- Commands are executed on the core thread as soon as they are queued (if core thread is not busy with previous commands)  
	 * 	- Core thread accessors are helpers for queuing commands. They perform better than queuing each command directly 
	 *    using queueCommand() or queueReturnCommand().
	 * 	- Accessors contain a command queue of their own, and queuing commands in them will not automatically start 
	 *    executing the commands like with queueCommand or queueReturnCommand. Instead you must manually call 
	 *    submitAccessors() when you are ready to send their commands to the core thread. Sending commands "in bulk" like 
	 *    this is what makes them faster than directly queuing commands.
	 * 	- Synced accessor is a special type of accessor which may be accessed from any thread. Its commands are always 
	 *    executed after all other non-synced accessors. It is primarily useful when multiple threads are managing the same
	 *    resource and you must ensure proper order of operations. You should use normal accessors whenever possible as 
	 *    synced accessors involve potentially slow synchronization operations.
