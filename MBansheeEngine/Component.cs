    /// void OnInitialize() - Called once when the component is instantiated. Only called when the game is playing.
    /// void OnUpdate() - Called every frame while the game is running and the component is enabled.
    /// void OnEnable() - Called whenever a component is enabled, or instantiated as enabled in which case it is called 
    ///                   after OnInitialize. Only called when the game is playing or paused.
    /// void OnDisable() - Called whenever a component is disabled. This includes destruction where it is called before 
    ///                    OnDestroy. Only called when the game is playing or paused.
    /// void OnDestroy() - Called before the component is destroyed. Destruction is usually delayed until the end of the 
    ///                    current frame unless specified otherwise in a call to Destroy. 
    /// void OnReset() - Called when script assemblies have been refreshed or when the component is initialized. During
    ///                  initialization it is called after OnInitialize but before OnEnable. Only relevant in editor.
