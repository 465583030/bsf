	 * @brief	You can use this class as a storage for reading and writing from/to various GPU resources. 
	 *			It is meant to be created on sim thread and used on the core thread. This class is abstract
	 *			and specific resource types need to implement their own type of GpuResourceData.
	 * 			
	 * @note	Normal use of this class involves requesting an instance of GpuResourceData from a GpuResource,
	 *			then scheduling a read or write on that resource using the provided instance.
	 *			Instance will be locked while it is used by the core thread and sim thread will be allowed to
	 *			access it when the operation ends. Caller can track AsyncOps regarding the read/write operation
	 *			to be notified when it is complete.
	 *
	 *			If you allocate an internal buffer to store the resource data, the ownership of the buffer
	 * 			will always remain with the initial instance of the class. If that initial instance
	 * 			is deleted, any potential copies will point to garbage data.
