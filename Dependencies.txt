This document lists all Banshee 3rd party libraries and provides information on how to compile
and include them in your own project. It is meant to be used as a guide to create your own Banshee
project file, potentially for compiler/IDE other than Visual Studio. Normally these files will be
provided pre-compiled for you.

BansheeEngine relies on the following 3rd party libraries:
 - Mono 3.8.0
    - http://www.mono-project.com
	- See MonoIntegrationGuide.txt on how to compile & integrate Mono

BansheeCore relies on the following 3rd party libraries:
 - NVIDIA Texture Tools 2.0.8
    - https://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/
	- See NVTTCompilationGuide.txt on how to compile it for Banshee

Place dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Banshee plug-in dependencies:

BansheeFBXImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FBX SDK 2015.1
   - http://usa.autodesk.com/fbx

BansheeFreeImgImporter (optional) relies on:
 - FreeImage 3.13.1
  - http://freeimage.sourceforge.net

BansheeFontImporter (optional) relies on:
 - Freetype 2.3.5
  - http://www.freetype.org
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: When compiling as static library make sure to define "FREETYPE2_STATIC". It is not defined by default
    in provided Visual Studio projects, which can cause a headache.

BansheeOISInput (optional) relies on:
 - BansheeOIS - Slightly modified version of OIS 1.3 specifically for Banshee
  - Supplied with Banshee source code but compiled as a separate project into a dependency

BansheeD3D11RenderSystem & BansheeD3D9RenderSystem (both optional) rely on:
 - Microsoft DirectX SDK June 2010
  - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
  - After installing the SDK make sure DXSDK_DIR environment variable is set up pointing to the installation path

BansheeSL (optional) relies on:
 - Bison 2.7
  - Install as a tool dependency, in its own folder as Bison/bison.exe (+ any dependant files)
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/files/
 - Flex 2.5.37
  - Install as a tool dependency, in its own folder as Flex/flex.exe
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/files/

Place plug-in specific dependency files in:
 - Library include files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/Include
 - Static library files in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/lib/(Platform)/(Configuration)
 - Tools (executables) in (BansheeRootDir)/(PluginDir)/Dependencies/tools
 - Dynamic library files in (BansheeRootDir)/bin/(Platform)/(Configuration)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Legend:
  (BansheeRootDir) - Path to BansheeEngine folder
  (Platform) - Platform you're compiling for, e.g. x86, x64, etc.
  (Configuration) - Debug, Release, DebugRelease

Other notes:
 - Some dependencies might not come with DebugRelease binaries, in which case use Release binaries (copy them to DebugRelease folder)
 - If you wish to compile managed assemblies using Microsoft compiler (e.g. using Visual Studio) yet still be able to debug
   the generated assemblies, you must install Mono 3.8.0., set up an environment variable MONO_INSTALL_DIR pointing to the Mono 
   installation directory. When this is set up "pdb2mdb" script will trigger on next compile generating the needed debug symbols.
