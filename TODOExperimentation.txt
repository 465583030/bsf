-------------------------
FBX
Next:
 - DefaultMeshData is defined in BansheeEngine but FBXImporter only includes Banshee Core
  - Therefore I am not using it in FBXImporter but I should

Later:
 - Import keyframes
  - ?? TODO
 - Add methods for calculating normals and tangent frame. This is especially needed for blend shapes as I believe they
   come with tangent frame or normal information. I've marked points in code where this is needed with a TODO.
 
Create a set of output data that is retrieved from the FBX. Then convert that data to Banshee mesh/animation/etc.
For now I would only use the mesh part but later I can just take the rest of the data as needed without messing with the
FBX importer.
