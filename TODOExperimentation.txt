-------------------------
FBX
Next:
 - DefaultMeshData is defined in BansheeEngine but FBXImporter only includes Banshee Core
  - Therefore I am not using it in FBXImporter but I should
 - When import animation generate slopes for quaternion rotation curves
 - Add methods for calculating normals and tangent frame. This is especially needed for blend shapes as I believe they
   come with tangent frame or normal information. I've marked points in code where this is needed with a TODO.
